#POSSIBLE WAYS TO MEASURE JUGGLING SPEED
#	peaks/throws/catches per minute
#		an issue with this is that the cascade and chops with the same number of peaks per second
#			is faster(i think)
#	size of juggling pattern
#	IF WE MAKE A GENERAL SPEED RATING, then we could also make a button that takes us to a video that 
#		shows that speed rating. then we could have 2 numbers for the upper and lower bounds, if the jugglers speed
#		is under or lower than those numbers, than the min/max speeds are sent, if between, then a percentage is sent
#		this rating could use:
#			the size of a bounding box of all balls
#				the movement of that box
#			the velocity of all balls
#				OR MAYBE all we would need to use is the velocity of all balls

#FOR TRIGGERED EVENTS:
#	if we make each event instance able to be either on or off, then in order to trigger events, we just have to have a way
#		to indicate the event type, instance and if we want it to be on/off/toggled. 
#			to do this we should make the ui window larger, put on/off checkmarks before wach instance, and add some option menus
#				next to the midi inputs, 1 for event type, and 1 for instance number

#	instead of using the optionmenu dropdowns for the pathpoint path configs, we should use instance numbers that allow the
#		user to assoicate any number of balls with the path configs, that way these instances can be either turned on or
#		off by other events triggers.
#			one issue with this, and it may be an issue with other event types, it conflicting path configs, for instance if a
#			ball is already associated with X in instance 0 where ball1,2,3 are all Xs, then instance 1 is turned on inwhich
#			ball 1 is associated with Y, then they will conflict. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
#				if a new instance being turned on contradicts an instance that is currently on, it turns it off
